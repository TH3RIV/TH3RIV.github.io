# Project MUNI
## Overview

A very simple one page concept to showcase the lore and images for one of the most hated champions in the League of Legends world - Teemo. Now the idea was to replace every mention of Teemo with my friends online alias and make it to embody the spirit of the devil.

## Technology

The project uses a couple of markup languages and a framework:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

## Final Thoughts

Made purely for fun and to learn more about styling using Bootstrap. All rights to the text and images belong to Riot Games.
